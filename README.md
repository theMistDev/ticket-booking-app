# book_tickets

A new Flutter project to handle tickets. This was built as a refresher of my Flutter skills. Suitable for airlines, booking sites, hotels, and other agencies that handle tickets or bookings.

## Scope
No API calls were made but placeholders can be adapted to integrate with relevant APIs as needed.
